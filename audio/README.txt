Place your background music files in this folder.

The project is set up for Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Name your audio files as follows:
  spring.mp3   Spring
  summer.mp3   Summer
  autumn.mp3   Autumn
  winter.mp3   Winter

If you use different filenames, edit the src values in BGM_TRACKS in audio.js (in the project root).

Supported formats: MP3, OGG, WAV, and other formats supported by the browser.
Use the "Track" dropdown in the UI to switch between BGM tracks.
